WELCOME TO DASHPAY!!

The DashPay organization houses all GitHub activity related to Dash.

Previously, all development related to Dash Platform happened under the [dashevo](https://github.com/dashevo/) GitHub organization. However, we have since archived the repositories in dashevo and moved everything to the current dashpay GitHub organization.

By consolidating all Dash-related activities under one organization, we aim to simplify the process of developer contribution to both [Dash Core](https://github.com/dashpay/dash) and [Dash Platform](https://github.com/dashpay/platform).

[Vist our website](https://www.dash.org/) to know more about Dash. 

See the [Dash Core documentation](https://dashcore.readme.io/) for further information about Dash Core.

See the [Dash Platform documentation](https://dashplatform.readme.io/docs) for further information about Dash's Web3 platform.
