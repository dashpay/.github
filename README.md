WELCOME TO DASHPAY!!

The DashPay organization houses all GitHub activity related to Dash.

Previously, all development related to Dash Platform happened under the dashevo GitHub. However, we have since archived the repositories in Dashevo and moved everything to the DashPay GitHub.

By consolidating all Dash-related activities under one organization, we aim to simplify the process of developer contribution to both Dash Core and Dash Platform.

[Vist our website](https://www.dash.org/) to know more about Dash. 

See the [Dash Platform documentation](https://dashplatform.readme.io/docs) for further information about Dash's Web3 platform.
